# Habitica Warrior Development
Shared Jupyter Notebook is an implementation of [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) mechanics for the Warrior. It is used to find optimum development path for the Warrior class considering maxing out Int and Str and allocating zero to Con and Per. 

# Results
The optimal ratio between Int and Str is 1.5 for the Warrior. Thus the development should be planned accordingly taking into considerations future gear.
